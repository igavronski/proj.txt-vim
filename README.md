# No frills project management

### 2017-02-23 - vim syntax file created, very short and simple rules:

A project is simply a line in the file, preferably starting at column 1

Indent subtasks under the project

Mark projects or tasks as important using a star `*` before the task, followed by any number of spaces

Mark tasks as done by using a lowercase `x` before the task, followed by any number of spaces

#### Todo:

* Recursively mark as done tasks under the project, when marking it as complete.

* Adding more sophisticated project management stuff, such as due dates, percent task completion, prerequisites, etc.
